{"name":"SWAP","tagline":"SWTOR Analyzer and Parser","body":"SWAP (Star Wars Analyzer & Parser) is a new open-source *Star Wars: The Old Republic* combat log parser written in the [Python programming language](http://python.org).\r\n\r\n### [Download SWAP v0.8.4e (32-bit, Installer)](http://faultexception.com/swap/downloads/swap-v0.8.4e-setup.exe)\r\nIf you know what you're doing, look below for more options.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* **100% open-source:** You can delve into our code, change stuff, send it back to us, or fork it! (Note: SWAP server source-code not available yet.)\r\n* **P2P raids:** SWAP doesn't synchronize raids using our central servers, instead we use [NAT traversal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal) to establish a direct connection to one of the raid members. If that's not possible we use our servers as a relay to that raid member.\r\n* **Low CPU footprint:** Lower idle parsing CPU usage than MOX parser.\r\n* **Overlays:** Our overlays are always on top, have no title bar, can be dragged, clicked and resized, all without losing focus on the game. You can even enable \"Click-through Overlays\"\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n|     | OS   | Version   | Link   | Notes |\r\n| --- | ---- | --------- | ------ | ----- |\r\n| ![icon](http://faultexception.com/swap/nsis-orange.png) | Windows 32-bit | v0.8.4e | [Installer](http://faultexception.com/swap/downloads/swap-v0.8.4e-setup.exe) | Requires Administrator |\r\n| ![icon](http://faultexception.com/swap/zip.png) | Windows 32-bit | v0.8.4e | [Zip Archive](http://faultexception.com/swap/downloads/swap-v0.8.4e.zip) | |","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

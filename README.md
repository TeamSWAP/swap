# README

SWAP (Star Wars Analyzer & Parser) is a new open-source *Star Wars: The Old Republic* combat log parser
written in the [Python programming language](http://python.org).

## Running
SWAP requires a few dependencies for you to be able to run it directly:

* Python 2.7+ recommended
* [wxPython](http://wxpython.org) for Python 2.7
* [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/) for Python 2.7

Once dependencies are installed

    python run.py

or, if you want to skip the installer:

    python src/swap.py
